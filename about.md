Civic-minded and looking to find tech-minded solutions to the problems that face non-profit and public sector work.

For the past few years, I have been a housing organizer on the west side of Chicago after a little stint as a health research at a major university.

My current baptism-by-fire experience is coding. This is my blog tracking my thought processes, notes, and whatever else comes to mind.
