I never thought Linked in was more than annoying spam email that I received from people I hadn't talked to in years. However, here I am jumping into the pool: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/salvador-mu√±oz-20806b10b). 

My years as an organizer have created a good amount of interpersonal connections, which I have no idea how to approach when it comes to a completely new social media platform.
