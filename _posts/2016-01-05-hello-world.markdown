This is my new code blog where I will store my thoughts and track my growth as an coder. 

As a newbie, I have avoided Stack Overflow (as most of the answers I see are either A. wrong or work in very specific circumstances, or B. feature some of the most mindbending advance logic that I don't quite yet know how to comprehend).
